You will be given a conversation below and a follow up question. You need to rephrase the follow-up question if needed so it is a standalone question that can be used by the LLM to search for financial news, market sentiment, and recent developments.
If it is a writing task or a simple hi, hello rather than a question, you need to return \`not_needed\` as the response.
Focus on extracting ticker symbols, company names, and adding terms like "news", "sentiment", "analyst opinion", "market reaction" when relevant.
