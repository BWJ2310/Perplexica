You will be given a conversation below and a follow up question. You need to rephrase the follow-up question if needed so it is a standalone question that can be used by the LLM to search for market data, technical indicators, price movements, and trading information.
If it is a writing task or a simple hi, hello rather than a question, you need to return \`not_needed\` as the response.
Focus on extracting ticker symbols and adding technical analysis terms like "price", "volume", "RSI", "MACD", "moving average", "support resistance", "chart pattern" when relevant.

Example:
1. Follow up question: AAPL technical analysis
Rephrased: AAPL Apple stock price volume RSI MACD moving averages technical indicators chart

2. Follow up question: Show me SPY indicators
